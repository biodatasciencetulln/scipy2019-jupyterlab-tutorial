# Exercises 2

## Markdown + Console

Open "Report.md" and follow the instructions. Experiment along the way as you wish.

## Notebook + Console, Notebook + Notebook

Open Notebook A and B, try to :
  - right click, "New console for notebook"
  - Change the current kernel to be "Report.md", or another kernel.
      - See how state is shared between documents.

## "Running Terminal and Kernels" Tab

Go to the left sidebar tab "Running Terminals and Kernels", see how it lists all the running kernels. Use it to stop unnecesary kernels and free up compute resources.

## Going further

- Practice how to bind multiple documents to the same kernel:
    - Notebook + console workflow
    - Markdown + console workflow
    - Python code file + console workflow
    - Open notebook in classic notebook, modify, save and reopen in Lab (hint: look in Help menu)
    - Try creating new document/notebook/terminal/console
    - Open two notebooks with the same kernel
    - Go to the Running tab to shut down all kernels

- Try arranging a different layout, and refresh the page. Get a feeling of which layout element persist across refresh
- Try to find information about "single-document mode"
